# sbootil

An utility to interface with Samsung S-BOOT bootloaders. It doesn't do
much currently.

Most of the information that this project is based on was gained from
reverse-engineering an S-BOOT binary. Parts of the reversed information
have been documented in the [cs02-hwdoc](https://github.com/timschumi/cs02-hwdoc)
repository.

Additionally, [Heimdall](https://github.com/Benjamin-Dobell/Heimdall) has
been consulted for some easy to digest information about the Download Mode
protocol.
